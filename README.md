# üì¶ Product Catalog Microservice

This is a **Node.js + Elasticsearch** based microservice that provides a searchable product catalog. It supports product variants, attributes, categories, supplier info, and neck styles, with flexible full-text and filtered search.

## üöÄ Features

* Full-text search across **name, description, supplier, and category**
* Attribute-based filtering (e.g. `color=red&size=L&neck_style=V-Neck`)
* Category filtering (e.g. `category=T-Shirts`)
* Fuzzy matching (`q=shrt` ‚Üí matches `"shirt"`)
* Sorting by **sales** (popularity) and relevance
* Dockerized environment with Elasticsearch + API + sample data loader

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Node.js** (Express) ‚Äì API service
* **Elasticsearch** ‚Äì Search engine
* **Docker Compose** ‚Äì Container orchestration

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Run

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd product-catalog
```

### 2. Build and run services

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

> Note: It takes some time to start all services and run the script to load sample data. Make sure it finishes before using the API.

To use Swagger documentation go to [http://localhost:3000/docs](http://localhost:3000/docs)

This starts:

* **Elasticsearch** on `http://localhost:9200`
* **Kibana** on `http://localhost:5601`
* **API service** on `http://localhost:3000`

The script `load-sample-data.sh` automatically loads sample T-Shirt products (including V-Neck and Round-Neck) into Elasticsearch.
