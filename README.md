## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Node.js** (Express) ‚Äì API service  
- **Elasticsearch** ‚Äì Search engine  
- **Docker Compose** ‚Äì Container orchestration

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Run

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd product-catalog
```

### 2. Build and run services
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Note : it takes some time to establish all services and run scribt to put sample data make sure it finished before you start using the API.

to use swagger documentation go to http://localhost:3000/docs

This starts:
- **Elasticsearch** on `http://localhost:9200`  
- **Kibana** on `http://localhost:5601`  
- **API service** on `http://localhost:3000`  

The script `load-sample-data.sh` automatically loads sample T-Shirt products into Elasticsearch.
